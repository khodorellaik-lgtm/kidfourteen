          “Khodor Ellaik got his start as the snarling frontman of a Cramps-style boogie-punk band … but he broke out on his own
          and took the plunge into industrial, post-punk, and noise-pop … Kid Fourteen’s music is a midnight ritual of drum machine beats,
          pulsing synth arpeggiators, and metallic guitar squall.”

          Kid Fourteen is the last man dancing to an illusory tune in his head.”

          “The eerily enveloping <i>Learning How to Die</i> comes via Paris-based artist Kid Fourteen… aesthetically resembling King Krule’s atmospheric allure.
          The brooding soundscape finds compelling accompaniment in lyrics reflecting the unfairness in society, particularly among the homeless and displaced.”
